==================================
Field Type Creation Simplification
==================================

Overview
========

First provide a couple of default implementations on the
``eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\FieldType`` class. Omit all optional methods from
the tutorial__.

Include additional "follow up" sections in the tutorial describing which
methods should be overwritten in which use cases, like:

* Verify value object integrity

* Add configurable validations

* Add field type settings

* Implement a custom value object

  * Implement custom hashing

* Enhance the indexing of the field type

* Store or retrieve external data

This way the developer quickly gets to a functional working result which then
can be extended. If a new developer has to touch too many classes or other code
artifacts (configuration …) it will be really hard for them to debug all those
common subtile issues (naming, …).

There are additional methods which can be implemented by default, even it
reduces the default functionality. But it will allow external developers to
come up with an extensible working state a lot faster::

    protected function checkValueStructure(CoreValue $value)
    {
        // Just do not check anything by default
    }

    public function getEmptyValue()
    {
        return new {$this->valueClass}();
    }

    public function getName(SPIValue $value)
    {
        // @TODO: Check if __toString is actually defined and throw an
        // exception otherwise, because it is not part of the SPIValue
        // interface
        return (string) $value;
    }

    protected function getSortInfo(CoreValue $value)
    {
        return $this->getName($value);
    }

    public function fromHash($hash)
    {
        if ($hash === null) {
            return $this->getEmptyValue();
        }

        // The default constructor at least works for the top level objects.
        // For more complex values a manual conversion is necessary.
        return new {$this->valueClass}($hash);
    }

    public function toHash(SPIValue $value)
    {
        // Simplest way to ensure a deep structure is cloned and converted into
        // scalars and has maps.
        return json_decode(json_encode($value), true);
    }

Especially the hashing functions define assumptions about the vlaue object
which might or might not be true. They expect the default constructor which
assignes all array keys as properties on the value object. This must be
documented when documenting custom value objects and their hashing methods. The
hash methods can still be overwritten…

This leaves only two methods to implement:

* ``getFieldTypeIdentifier()``

  Obviously necessary.

* ``createValueFromInput($inputValue)``

  This requires explanation how this integrates with the edit template (which
  is missing entirely in the tuorial) and where this data comes from. Web
  developers tend to try stuff in the web interface and the connecting dots are
  missing to be able to do this.

The Type Class
--------------

Right now it is quite tedious to develop a new field type because of various
issues:

* Development Experience: Watching fatal errors and SF HTML error responses in
  AJAX requests in the browser debug bar. (Probably resolved in next version)

* Tutorial missing edit and settings templates – the latter causes Internal
  Server Errors and a broken view.

  There is a pull request to make the settings template optional again and thus
  it should be documented in the relevant tutorial section (about settings).

  The edit template seems necessary to properly try out the field type and
  should be documented.

* Field type indentifier MUST NOT contain dashes so that Twig template blocks
  work. We should probably document (and verify or normalize) them as
  ``/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/``.

We should probably document the field type base test class
``eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Tests\FieldTypeTest`` which allows to test drive a
new field type, making sure all the trivial errors will not occur (hidden in
AJAX responses).

To make it even easier we can again provide sensible defaults for all methods
which are optional to implement:

* ``getValidatorConfigurationSchemaExpectation``
* ``getSettingsSchemaExpectation``

The Value Class
---------------

The value class must be defined by the developer, while they can use a default
one. We should define some based on common types, like::

    class NumericValue extends Value
    {
        public $value = 0;

        public function __toString(): string
        {
            return (string) $this->value;
        }
    }

This value can then just be referenced to the type constructor in the
dependency injection container so that the ``$valueClass`` property is set
properly in the type.

The Converter
-------------

Together with the hash related methods most of a converter can also be
implemented with sane defaults::

    class Converter implements ConverterInterface
    {
        protected $indexColumn;

        public function __construct($indexColumn = 'sort_key_string')
        {
            $this->indexColumn = $indexColumn;
        }

        public function toStorageValue(FieldValue $value, StorageFieldValue $storageFieldValue)
        {
            $storageFieldValue->dataText = json_encode($value->data);
            $storageFieldValue->sortKeyString = $value->sortKey;
            $storageFieldValue->sortKeyInt = $value->sortKey;
        }

        public function toFieldValue(StorageFieldValue $value, FieldValue $fieldValue)
        {
            $fieldValue->data = json_decode($value->dataText, true) ?: [];
            $fieldValue->sortKey = $value->sortKeyInt ?? $value->sortKeyString;
        }

        public function toStorageFieldDefinition(FieldDefinition $fieldDef, StorageFieldDefinition $storageDef)
        {
        }

        public function toFieldDefinition(StorageFieldDefinition $storageDef, FieldDefinition $fieldDef)
        {
        }

        public function getIndexColumn()
        {
            return $this->indexColumn;
        }
    }

This implementation allows to configure the mandatory definition of the
index column and provides a mostly sane defintionition for everything else.
Thus we do not need to implement anything either, but just configure the
converter in the dependency injection container.

The Templates
-------------

The last missing bit are the templates a developer has to specify. Since the
settings template will again be made optional, this leaves two templates to be
defined:

* The view

* The edit template

Template Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since those templates follow defined structures we should probably even write a
generator for these. The generator could create a full bundle (people could
then manually merge with an existing bundle) based on the specification of:

* An identifier

* The value class to use

It then has to generate:

* The type extension (both methods)

* The dependency injection container configuration

* The templates

* The configuration and DIC extension to register the templates

Testing The Field Type
----------------------

It would be really helpful to include instructions on how to use and test a
field type in the user interface since this is what most developers will want
to do. This is also essential to make sure the templates integrate properly.
